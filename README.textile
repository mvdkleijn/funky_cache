h3. Short history and status

The funky cache plugin for Wolf CMS was originally created by "tuupola":http://github.com/tuupola.
Maintainership for the plugin was later taken over by "mvdkleijn":http://github.com/mvdkleijn at tuupola's request since he no longer had time to work on it.
The current version of the plugin was tested to work on Wolf CMS 0.7.5 and upwards.

h3. Install

Copy the files to <i>wolf/plugins/funky_cache/</i> folder.

<pre>
cd wolf/plugins/
git clone git://github.com/mvdkleijn/funky_cache.git funky_cache
</pre>

Open your _config.php_ and make sure the following is set:

<pre>
define('USE_MOD_REWRITE', true);
</pre>

Go to the Wolf CMS admin interface and enable the Funky Cache plugin.

A _"Cache"_ tab should appear after enabling the plugin. Click on the tab and check your settings. 

_Cache file suffix_ is important! It is the suffix of static files written to disk. It should be the same as _URL_SUFFIX_ in wolf config.php.  If your _URL_SUFFIX_ is empty cache file suffix  will default to _.html_.

_Cache folder_ is the folder where the static files are written. The folder is relative to the document root of your web server. If you leave this empty, cached files will be written to the document root of your web server. *The web server MUST have write access to the cache folder.* 

!http://www.vanderkleijn.net/public/images/funky_cache/funky-cache-settings.png!

Go to the shell (or your FTP client) and create the cache folder and give the web server write access to it. For example:

<pre>
> cd /path/to/document/root/
> mkdir cache
> chmod a+w cache
</pre>

Funky Cache depends on correctly set up mod_rewrite rules. The rules are different depending on your Wolf CMS and plugin settings. Click on _"Example rewrite rules"_ in the plugin's sidebar. Cut and paste the given code for your web server to the .htaccess file (or its equivalent) in your document root.
